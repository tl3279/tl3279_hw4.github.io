I have a strong academic foundation, with dual undergraduate degrees in 
Biological Sciences and Economics from the University of California, Davis. 
My experience spans diverse research and lab work, including genome structural 
variation analysis, clinical trials on treatment efficacy, and various 
biostatistical projects. Additionally, I have hands-on lab experience in 
bacteriophage research and am familiar with statistical software like R, 
Python, SAS, and STATA.
